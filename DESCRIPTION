Description: Flow and mass cytometry are experimental techniques used for the characterization of cell phenotypes. With the increase of usable cell markers (up to 50 markers), the identification of cell populations through manual gating is impossible. These high-dimensional data require new computational algorithms to automatically identify cell clusters. The SPADE algorithm has been proposed as a new way to analysis and explore mass-cytometry data. This algorithm performs a density-based down-sampling combined with an agglomerative hierarchical clustering. While SPADE offers new opportunities for identifying cell populations, complementary approaches are needed to improve the characterization of identified cell populations. SPADEVizR is an R package designed to better visualize and analyze SPADE clustering results. We extended the original SPADE outputs with techniques such as parallel coordinates, heatmaps, multidimensional scaling, volcano plots or streamgraph representations. Moreover, the proposed statistical methods allow the identification of SPADE clusters with relevant biological behaviors. Significantly abundant clusters or differentially enriched clusters can be identified using SPADEVizR. In addition, the integration of cell cluster behaviors with additional phenotypical variables can be performed.
