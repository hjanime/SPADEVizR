Description: The Spanning tree Progression of Density normalized Events (SPADE) algorithm is powerful for mining flow and mass cytometry data. SPADE xxx. SPADEVizR is an R package dedicated to post-clustering analysis based on the . SPADEVizR is able to identify aboundant clusters (AC), differentially enriched clusters (DEC), and cluster correlating with phenotypical variables (CC). Moreover, SPADEVizR provides a large panel of visual representations such as parallel coordinates, phenotypical heatmap, stream graph representation, volcano plot representations. Through all these methods SPADEVizR constitutes a powerful pipeline for the analysis of cell clustering results provided by SPADE.
